# 📱 Android Forensics Timeline Correlation Tool

This project is part of a cybersecurity forensics investigation. It provides a Python-based tool for **correlating Android call logs, SMS records, and app usage patterns** from CSV data exported during mobile device analysis.

## 🔍 Project Purpose

The objective is to identify behavioural patterns by analysing:
- Call activity (incoming, outgoing, missed)
- SMS communications (sent and received)
- App usage events (open, close, time in foreground)

This helps forensic investigators and analysts visualise user activity over time, detect suspicious patterns, and provide context to specific events.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btolawoyin/dsa_cybersecurity.git
cd dsa_cybersecurity/ForensicsAnalysis
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate     # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add Your CSV Data

Place your data files inside the `/data` folder:

- `CallLog.csv`
- `SMS_Messages.csv`
- `AppUsage.csv`

Ensure each CSV includes a timestamp column such as `Date`, `timestamp_start`, etc.

## 🚀 Running the Analysis

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Load the data
- Merge all events into a single timeline
- Visualise the correlation between calls, texts, and app usage with a scatter plot

## 📊 Example Output

A forensic timeline showing when each communication or app event occurred:

```
| Time             | Event Type | Details              |
|------------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 2025-06-30 14:10 | Call       | Outgoing: +234801...  |
| 2025-06-30 14:11 | App        | WhatsApp opened       |
| 2025-06-30 22:15 | SMS        | Sent to +234902...    |
```
